      <description>I ran into a display formatting issue when trying to work on my blog from a different laptop. The problem was that when I initially built the site using Github and Hugo it was with an older version of Hugo. The theme being used hasn&amp;rsquo;t been updated in a while and probably isn&amp;rsquo;t compatible with the newer version of Hugo due to a change that was made somewhere along the line and never tested.</description>
