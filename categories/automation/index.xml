      <description>Recently, I had something come up with a client who was migrating from Hyper-V to vSphere. One of the administrators is a big PowerShell user and brought to my attention that the Microsoft Hyper-V and VMware PowerCLI modules share some of the cmdlet names. Duplicate names become an issue when trying to manage particular objects like VMs since both modules have the Get-VM cmdlet. Due to this conflict, he removed the PowerCLI module to continue maintaining the Hyper-V servers.</description>

      <title>ESXi USB Installer Scripted - Single</title>

      <description>In one of my previous posts, I shared the steps to manually configure a USB drive to create an unattended ESXi installation and have it install on itself. The process is not complicated and makes the installation of ESXi much quicker and zero-touch. The manual process of creating USB drives wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t very efficient and did not scale well. To be able to generate more than a few at a time turned out to be time-consuming.</description>

      <title>ESXi USB Installer - Manual</title>

      <description>Recently I came across the need to install hundreds of ESXi hosts on USB sticks and wanted to accomplish this in the easiest way possible. While installing ESXi isn&amp;rsquo;t complicated, it can be time-consuming and would require the need to be swapping the monitor and keyboard continually or having multiple monitors and keyboards. I wanted an unattended install method where I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to continue to touch each machine and have to go back configure it.</description>
