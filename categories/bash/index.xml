      <description>When trying to update the website hosted in GitHub from a different laptop there was an issue with the submodules not being updated on the new laptop correctly. After searching multiple sites to try and correct this issue I was finally able to figure out what the problem was. The public folder wasn&amp;rsquo;t being properly recognized as a submodule within my Github repository when cloning it to the new laptop.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking lots of screenshots lately for blog posts and find myself constantly updating the files and locations. I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of having to repeatedly rename multiple files or move them into the appropriate folder locations to keep them organized. The process is time-consuming, and since I don&amp;rsquo;t always write the blog post after performing the actions, it can lead to confusion. I did some searching and found that it&amp;rsquo;s straightforward to change the default location and name of screenshot files take with a Mac.</description>

      <description>Recently I came across the need to install hundreds of ESXi hosts on USB sticks and wanted to accomplish this in the easiest way possible. While installing ESXi isn&amp;rsquo;t complicated, it can be time-consuming and would require the need to be swapping the monitor and keyboard continually or having multiple monitors and keyboards. I wanted an unattended install method where I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to continue to touch each machine and have to go back configure it.</description>
