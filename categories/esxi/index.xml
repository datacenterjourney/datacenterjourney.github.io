      <description>I enjoy using a Mac both for work and at home. There is an issue that I have come upon more than one occasion, and it always takes me a while to remember how to fix it. Figured I could post it here so that I have it as a reference and maybe help someone else as well.
There are times when accessing the console for both ESXi and UCS KVM, where you are required to send the F11 key.</description>

      <description>After logging in to my ESXi host after some time away, I realized that it was still running vSphere 6.5u1. It was time to do an upgrade, and as stated in my last post, I&amp;rsquo;m running a nested lab environment from a single physical host. I am unable to leverage VUM (vCenter Upgrade Manager) to do the upgrades since my vCenter and everything else lives on the one host I need to upgrade.</description>

      <title>ESXi USB Installer Scripted - Single</title>

      <description>In one of my previous posts, I shared the steps to manually configure a USB drive to create an unattended ESXi installation and have it install on itself. The process is not complicated and makes the installation of ESXi much quicker and zero-touch. The manual process of creating USB drives wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t very efficient and did not scale well. To be able to generate more than a few at a time turned out to be time-consuming.</description>

      <title>ESXi USB Installer - Manual</title>

      <description>Recently I came across the need to install hundreds of ESXi hosts on USB sticks and wanted to accomplish this in the easiest way possible. While installing ESXi isn&amp;rsquo;t complicated, it can be time-consuming and would require the need to be swapping the monitor and keyboard continually or having multiple monitors and keyboards. I wanted an unattended install method where I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to continue to touch each machine and have to go back configure it.</description>
