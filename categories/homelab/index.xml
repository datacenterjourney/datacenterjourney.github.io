      <description>Back when I deployed my vSphere 6.5 environment in my lab, I wanted to be able to set up Enhanced Link Mode (ELM). To do that, you needed to have an external Platform Services Controller (PSC), but that is no longer the case. Starting in an early version of 6.7, you are now able to connect multiple vCenters in ELM without having to deploy an external PSC. Based on the design recommendations back in 6.</description>

      <title>Repoint VCSA to Different PSC</title>

      <description>To repoint your vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) to a different Platform Services Controller (PSC), you will need to use the cmsso-util repoint command. Using this process is for several different scenarios, including freeing up the capacity load, PSC maintenance, decommissioning a PSC, and various others.
To start, verify what PSC the VCSA is currently pointing to by logging into the VCSA and starting the Bash shell. Then run the command below to check what PSC is currently in use.</description>

      <title>vCenter 6.5 VAMI Updates Fail with Environment Not Ready</title>

      <description>In a previous post, I mentioned that it had been a while since I had logged into my lab environment, and it was time for some updates. I was running vCenter 6.5u1, and before going to 6.7 wanted to be on the latest release of 6.5. It also allowed me to document the process and share with others who might be inexperienced in how to perform updates from the VCSA (vCenter Server Appliance) VAMI (VMware Appliance Management Interface).</description>

      <title>Standalone ESXi Upgrade 6.5 to 6.7u3</title>

      <description>After logging in to my ESXi host after some time away, I realized that it was still running vSphere 6.5u1. It was time to do an upgrade, and as stated in my last post, I&amp;rsquo;m running a nested lab environment from a single physical host. I am unable to leverage VUM (vCenter Upgrade Manager) to do the upgrades since my vCenter and everything else lives on the one host I need to upgrade.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I had done much with my home lab and decided it was time to give it some much-needed attention. The last update it received was around the time that ESXi 6.5u1 was released. For those of you interested, I am currently running a Supermicro SYS-5028D-TN4T mini-tower running an Intel 8-core Xeon D-1540 processor with 128GB of memory. For network connectivity, it comes with 2x 10GbE and 2x 1GbE ports, and for storage, 4x 3.</description>
