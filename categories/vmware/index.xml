      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all come across the pesky invalid certificate error when trying to access vCenter, stating that your connection is not private. Many of us click through and &amp;ldquo;Accept the risk&amp;rdquo; because we know that the site we are accessing is legitimate. However, there are times where not having a trusted website can cause an issue and prevent specific actions. For example, without a trusted certificate, it blocks access to upload files to datastores.</description>

      <title>Decommission 6.7 Additional External Platform Services Controller(s) (PSC)</title>

      <description>Back when I deployed my vSphere 6.5 environment in my lab, I wanted to be able to set up Enhanced Link Mode (ELM). To do that, you needed to have an external Platform Services Controller (PSC), but that is no longer the case. Starting in an early version of 6.7, you are now able to connect multiple vCenters in ELM without having to deploy an external PSC. Based on the design recommendations back in 6.</description>

      <title>Repoint VCSA to Different PSC</title>

      <description>To repoint your vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) to a different Platform Services Controller (PSC), you will need to use the cmsso-util repoint command. Using this process is for several different scenarios, including freeing up the capacity load, PSC maintenance, decommissioning a PSC, and various others.
To start, verify what PSC the VCSA is currently pointing to by logging into the VCSA and starting the Bash shell. Then run the command below to check what PSC is currently in use.</description>

      <title>vCenter 6.5 VAMI Updates Fail with Environment Not Ready</title>

      <description>In a previous post, I mentioned that it had been a while since I had logged into my lab environment, and it was time for some updates. I was running vCenter 6.5u1, and before going to 6.7 wanted to be on the latest release of 6.5. It also allowed me to document the process and share with others who might be inexperienced in how to perform updates from the VCSA (vCenter Server Appliance) VAMI (VMware Appliance Management Interface).</description>

      <title>PowerShell Cmdlet Conflicts</title>

      <description>Recently, I had something come up with a client who was migrating from Hyper-V to vSphere. One of the administrators is a big PowerShell user and brought to my attention that the Microsoft Hyper-V and VMware PowerCLI modules share some of the cmdlet names. Duplicate names become an issue when trying to manage particular objects like VMs since both modules have the Get-VM cmdlet. Due to this conflict, he removed the PowerCLI module to continue maintaining the Hyper-V servers.</description>

      <title>Standalone ESXi Upgrade 6.5 to 6.7u3</title>
      <link>https://datacenterjourney.com/2019/standalone_esxi_upgrade_6.5_to_6.7u3/</link>

      <guid>https://datacenterjourney.com/2019/standalone_esxi_upgrade_6.5_to_6.7u3/</guid>
      <description>After logging in to my ESXi host after some time away, I realized that it was still running vSphere 6.5u1. It was time to do an upgrade, and as stated in my last post, I&amp;rsquo;m running a nested lab environment from a single physical host. I am unable to leverage VUM (vCenter Upgrade Manager) to do the upgrades since my vCenter and everything else lives on the one host I need to upgrade.</description>

      <title>Project Pacific Announcement</title>

      <description>For those of you that haven&amp;rsquo;t heard VMware made a few big announcements during this year&amp;rsquo;s VMworld US. One of the more interesting to me was the announcement of Project Pacific. In my opinion, this has to be one of the more critical and landscape changing for system administrators and developers. Think of it as the next evolution of vSphere and a step ladder for organizations to be able to implement an application platform.</description>

      <title>ESXi USB Installer Scripted - Single</title>
      <link>https://datacenterjourney.com/2019/esxi-usb-installer-scripted-single/</link>

      <guid>https://datacenterjourney.com/2019/esxi-usb-installer-scripted-single/</guid>
      <description>In one of my previous posts, I shared the steps to manually configure a USB drive to create an unattended ESXi installation and have it install on itself. The process is not complicated and makes the installation of ESXi much quicker and zero-touch. The manual process of creating USB drives wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t very efficient and did not scale well. To be able to generate more than a few at a time turned out to be time-consuming.</description>
